# Form components

Vunix provide components to create a form that you can use on your website.

## Inputs

Most of inputs on websites are mostly used without a complex validation and are often used for email, password, number, text and textarea. This is why instead of using a global `Input` component that will need to be customized, we have created a component for most of each of your needs with a custom design and validation.

### Input base

All input components herit of the `VInputBase` component.
