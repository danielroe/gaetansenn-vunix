# Introduction

Vunix provides a comprehensive set of components to help you build forms for your website. From basic input fields to complex form layouts, we've got you covered. And with our built-in validation process, you can ensure that user input is accurate and complete.

## Inputs

Our Input components offer a range of customized design and validation options for your website's input fields. Instead of relying on a generic Input component, we provide specific components for common input types such as email, password, number, text, and textarea. These components not only ensure a consistent design across your website, but also provide tailored validation to improve the user experience.

### Input base

The `VInputBase` component is a building block for form input fields that are based on the HTML `<input>` element. It provides a set of common features such as leading and trailing icons, which are inherited by other input components like `VInputText` and `VInputEmail`.
